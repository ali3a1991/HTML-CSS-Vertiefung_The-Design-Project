            <h2>Every idea<img src="./assets/image/idea.png" alt="">starts with a need</h2>
            <p>
                Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
                my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
                some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
                phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
                made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
                the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.
            </p>
            <h2>After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot</h2>

                <h3><img src="./assets/image/title02.svg" alt="">Start with asking why</h3>
                <p>You will start seeing things differently and
                    coming up with more effective ways of achieving
                    goals.

                <p>By looking at problems from a different
                    perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more

                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing
                    work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.
                    You will learn to accept feedback and learn from
                    it.
